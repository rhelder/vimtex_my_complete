# My VimTeX Completion Files

These include completion files for my own style file, as well as completion
files for packages that I frequently use but are not included in VimTeX's
collection of completion files.

Acknowledgments:

*   The completion files for all of the packages that I did not write are
    based on [@texstudio-org](https://github.com/texstudio-org)'s [`cwl`
    files](https://github.com/texstudio-org/texstudio/tree/master/completion).
*   I converted these files from TeXstudio's format to VimTeX's format using
    [@lervag](https://github.com/lervag)'s `convert-cwl` script that ships out
    with [VimTeX](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex).
